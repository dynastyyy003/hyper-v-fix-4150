# Hyper-V Bridge network connection (External Network)

A fix for those who want to use WSL 2 on bridge networking.

> Basically, this is my first time doing Github stuff, and I don't know much about it. So, with that said, let me get started.



# The Issue

I'm starting out in the world of digital cybersecurity, and I've often found myself having trouble using many programs or scripts that required my virtual machine (WSL) to have a connection to the external network.

Personally, up until the moment I'm posting this, I haven't found any tutorial on YouTube that could actually solve the problem without exhaustive steps, without losing my virtual machine's IP and having to format it, etc.
